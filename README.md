# clearly :)
## Clear and accurate real-time monitor for celery

`Clearly` is an alternative to [flower](https://github.com/mher/flower).
While I do like flower, to me it's not been totally up to the task (pun intended :)).
Why is that? I'd like _actual_ real-time monitoring, filter multiple tasks at once, syntax coloring and complete, whole, thorough, comprehensive results!
And flower needs page refreshes, filters only one task at a time, displays results as plain strings and on top of that truncates them... ðŸ˜ž

Ok, `clearly` does provide all that!  
It is actual real-time, has multiple simultaneous filters, an advanced syntax coloring system, and complete non-truncated results! Oh, and it works right in the (i)python terminal :)
It's great to actually _see_ what's going on in your celery tasks, all in real-time! So it's great for debugging and demoing.

Now, `clearly` even has an outer process server!
You can always connect to it, and see the last 10,000 tasks, anytime.
This makes `clearly` quite complete, and can even substitute flower entirely.

It's only missing a Docker image for simple deploying now.
And a command line to call the client directly from the shell!
(spoilers :))

See what `clearly` looks like:
![very cool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsalmei/clearly/master/img/clearly_highlights.png)


## Requirements

To use `clearly`, you currently need to:
- enable *Events* (`celery worker -E`)

and you're good to go!

Highlights:
- any version of celery will work, from 3.1 to 4.2+ :)
- a result backend is not mandatory (but used if available :)
- now the code supports both python 2.7 and python 3.4+ :)


## How `clearly` works

This tool creates a background thread with a celery events receiver, which receives events from all clients and all workers connected, dynamically updating states.

These events are processed, and missing or out of order ones are dynamically generated, so you never see a STARTED task before it being RECEIVED, which would be weird.
The parameters of the tasks are dynamically (and safely) compiled, and beautifully syntax colored, while tasks completed get their results directly from the result backend if available, to overcome the problem of truncated results.
All async workers' life cycles are also processed and listed on screen.
All tasks triggered show up immediately on screen, and you start seeing what's going on with those tasks, in real-time!

At any moment, you can CTRL+C out of the client, and rest assured that the background thread will continue gathering all updates seamlessly.

DO NOT FEAR the memory consumption! It is very optimized, and by default only stores 1000 tasks and 100 workers at a time. You can increase them though.


## Features

`clearly` enables you to:
- Be informed of any and all tasks being requested and running, in real-time;
- Know the workers available and be notified if any goes down;
- Filter the async calls any way you want;
- Inspect the actual parameters the tasks were called with;
- See and analyze the outcome of these tasks, such as success results or fail tracebacks;
- _Clearly_ see all types and representations of the parameters/outcomes of the tasks with an advanced printing system, syntax highlighting and symbols, similar to what your favorite REPL would do;
- Analyze stats of your system.


## Get `clearly`

1. `pip install -U clearly`
2. that's all!


## How to use

### initialize it

```python
from yourproject.celeryconf import app
from clearly.server import ClearlyServer
from clearly.client import ClearlyClient
clearlycli = ClearlyClient(ClearlyServer(app))
```

### grab them

```python
clearlycli.capture()
```


### be amazed
![very amazed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsalmei/clearly/master/img/clearly_amazed.png)


### you can also grab like

```python
clearlycli.capture(params=True)
```


### and also be amazed

### note
Any way you capture them, `clearly` is always storing the same data about the tasks. The `params` is only informative, for you to see them right in the capture mode. You can see them later too, after capturing.
(The default is to show `error`s, as they are much more likely to get your interest).

## Hints

- write a small [celery router](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/routing.html#routers) and in there generate dynamic routing keys, based on the actual arguments of the async call in place.
That way, you'll be able to filter tasks based on any of those constraints, like an id of an entity.
- if you're using [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [django-extensions](https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions), put in your settings a `SHELL_PLUS_POST_IMPORT` to auto import this!
Just create a module to initialize a `clearlycli` instance and you're good to go, the shell_plus will have it always available!
Now you have a tool always ready to be used, without importing or creating anything, to actually see what's going on in your tasks, even in production :)
(soon there will be a command line to get even easier to this)
- the more you filter, the less you'll have to analyze, so find the best combination for you debugging needs. A busy system can have thousands of tasks per minute.


## To do

- ~~support python 3 (not actually tested yet, soon);~~
- ~~split `Clearly` client and server, to allow a always-on server to run, and multiple clients connect;~~
- include a script mode, to call right from the shell;
- any other ideas welcome!
